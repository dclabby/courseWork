- AVG ignores NULL values, so that rows with NULL values are not countec. IF we want to treat NULL as 0 then we need to calculate average as SUM(x)/COUNT(x)
- finding the median happens to be a pretty difficult thing to get using SQL alone â€” so difficult that finding a median is occasionally asked as an interview question.*/
